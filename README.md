# -RANSOMWARE_project : using Python, Cryptography Library, PyInstaller, Virtual Machine
SIMULATING A RANSOMWARE ATTACK :  Developed a ransomware simulation in Python, demonstrating encryption and decryption of user files.
• Utilized the Cryptography library to implement AES encryptioNn for file security, simulating ransomware behavior.
• Conducted the simulation in a controlled virtual environment to safely test ransomware behavior.
• Focused on ethical hacking principles and creating awareness of ransomware threats and prevention strategies.
